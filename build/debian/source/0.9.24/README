INFO
Build will create three packages with different binaries.
- almond-monitor		Standard Almond binary	HTML, Metrics, API, Kafka
- almond-monitor-avro		Almond binary as standard but with additional support for Avro schemas
- almond-monitor-minimal	Almond binary without support for Kafka.

Only one of the three packages should be deployed on the same server.

NOTE: Nagios plugin binaries included in this source package are compiled for jammy. If you install on a different version of Ubuntu, you need to update included binaries in /opt/almond/utilities and /opt/almond/plugins.
