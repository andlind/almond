ALMOND MODS

Almond mods is scripts that integrate with almond.conf and can be executed from the howru service
if mods are enabled in the configuration. You can write your own mods, preferable in Python and place
them in the mods directory. However, it is not recommended to have more than two mods enabled at the
same time and they should not do any heavy tasks rather a simple conversion or calculation based on the
json output from the Almond process.
